## Getting Started

Before running anything for the first time, make sure to generate the data files:

### `npm run create-data-files`
This command creates the input files for each puzzle, each containing placeholder variables where you can paste your own puzzle input.

---

## Running the App

### `npm start`
Starts the app in development mode.

Once running, open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to view the interface.

- The page automatically reloads when you make changes.
- Any linting errors will show up in the console.
